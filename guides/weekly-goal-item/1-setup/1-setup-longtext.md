## Text - formatted according to [the style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KrUSlkgmklM7aqRV1VmsgT0ExjKpIeLW3cDXTEVrzEM/edit?usp=sharing)

This section is here to mirror the [diff guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x-7JrtLswwFnXD_ggjxILC8rLLksC5IL6D9qCLLMxgo/edit), and doesn't necessarily pertain to Causeway or have a one-to-one. It's merely a presentation of the starter file for the component's TypeScript file. See the ``2-static-long-text.md`` where I wrote extensively on writing HTML and SCSS.
